# goodreads-to-obsidian
Take a Goodreads CSV export and convert that into markdown notes for Obsidian

## Is it done?
No. This is still in progress.

## Who is this for?
For those who want to migrate all of their existing Goodreads book data to individual markdown files in Obsidian. Then you plan to stop adding new books to Goodreads.

## How do I do this?
1. Optionally, prepare your Vault with a book template (think about including this as .md)
2. Optionally, build a books dashboard (think about including this as .md)
3. Login to Goodreads.
4. Export your books to CSV under My Books (think of sample book format)
6. Run `csv-to-md.py` 
7. Optionally, build some books dashboard
8. Add new books with this other great plugin [Obsidian Book Search](https://github.com/anpigon/obsidian-book-search-plugin)

## Why would I want this?
If you're planning to do all future book reviews in a private Obsidian vault, but have a bunch of book `read` data that you want to bring with you.

## What happens to my data in Goodreads?
Nothing, unless you choose to take some action. This is just a simple data converter.

## What about new books that I read?
You could use another great plugin `Goodsidian` to add new books directly to Obsidian. This one won't do that.

## What if I want to keep using Goodreads?
Then this probably is not for you. However, there are some solutions that do that! Like [Goodsidian](https://github.com/selfire1/goodsidian) - which takes updates from your feeds of active Goodreads use and puts those into Obsidian. That wasn't what I wanted!
